# CFT Landing Zone (Migrate for Compute Engine)

## âš  Deprecated

This module has been deprecated. For general guidance on landing zones, please refer to [terraform-example-foundation](https://github.com/terraform-google-modules/terraform-example-foundation).

## Google Cloud Shell Walkthrough
A Google Cloud Shell Walkthrough has been setup to make it easy for users who are new to Migrate and Terraform. This walkthrough provides a set of instructions to get a default installation of Migrate setup that can be used in a production environment.

If you are familiar with Terraform and would like to run Terraform from a different machine, you can skip this walkthrough and move onto the [Deployment](#Deployment-Type) section.

## Migrate for Compute Engine Prerequisites

### Migration Qualification

Before proceeding with migration, you should already know:

1.  How many approximately VMs will be migrated
2.  What is migration target VMs source - Azure, AWS or on-prem
3.  How many GCP projects you will need for migrated VMs
4.  Do you have/plan on-prem or other cloud connection to GCP via [VPN](https://cloud.google.com/vpn/docs/concepts/overview) / [Interconnect](https://cloud.google.com/hybrid-connectivity/)
5.  Is there any network load balancing involved
6.  How much storage will be needed in GCP

### Deployment Type

There are two types of deployment that you can choose from using CFT for Migrate for Compute Engine:

**Single-project** deployment where Migrate for Compute Engine frontend, Cloud Extension and migrated VMs hosted under the same GCP project:

![Single Project](images/cft-velo-single.png)

**Multi-project** deployment, environment is split into four or more different GCP projects to host separated shared VPC, Migrate for Compute Engine frontend and migrated VMs:

**Example** of high level architecture for a multi project landing zone:

### Technical Prerequisites

CFT for Migrate for Compute Engine is build on top of [Google Cloud Project Factory Terraform Module](https://github.com/terraform-google-modules/terraform-google-project-factory) and if additional customization needed please refer to the [documentation](https://github.com/terraform-google-modules/terraform-google-project-factory/blob/master/README.md).

You will create the following via CFT and Terraform:

1.  GCP project to host Migrate for Compute Engine Manager and Cloud Extensions (CE)
1.  GCP VPC Project (if shared VPC will be used)
1.  VPC with subnets
1.  [Firewall rules](https://cloud.google.com/migrate/compute-engine/docs/4.5/concepts/planning-a-migration/network-access-requirements) for Migrate for Compute Engine
1.  GCP Network Tags for Migrate for Compute Engine
1.  Destination Projects
1.  GCP [roles and service accounts](https://cloud.google.com/migrate/compute-engine/docs/4.5/how-to/configuring-gcp/configuring-gcp-manually) for Migrate for Compute Engine
1.  VPN (Optional)

Finally [deploying](https://cloud.google.com/migrate/compute-engine/docs/4.5/how-to/configure-manager/configuring-on-gcp) Migrate for Compute Engine Manager via GCP [Marketplace](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/details/click-to-deploy-images/velostrata?_ga=2.230596124.-1830265044.1554384916&_gac=1.75634663.1564563946.CL6bne_m3uMCFYYkGwodLkkPoQ).
